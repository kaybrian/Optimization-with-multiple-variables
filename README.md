## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/kaybrian/Optimization-with-multiple-variables.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Optimization-with-multiple-variables`
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended): `python -m venv env`
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `env\Scripts\activate`
   - On Unix or Linux: `source env/bin/activate`
5. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Open the provided Jupyter Notebook (`Summative Assignment.ipynb`) in your preferred Python development environment.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to complete the code snippets for the five exercises.
3. The notebook includes unit tests that you need to pass to ensure your code is working correctly.
4. After completing the linear regression model, you will be required to create decision trees and random forests models.
5. Compare the Root Mean Squared Errors (RMSE) of the models and rank them accordingly.
